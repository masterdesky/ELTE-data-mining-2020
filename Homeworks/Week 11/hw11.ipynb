    "# HW 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Running the models may take minutes. This HW takes ~30 min to complete in computational time, so make sure you don't start it 1 hour before it is due.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tasks 2-4. should be done using the `sklearn` library, the last is a pure TensorFlow ([Keras is part of TensorFlow](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/releases#:~:text=since%20this%20release-,Keras%202.2.,well%20as%20Theano%20and%20CNTK)) example.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use tf.keras instead of the standalone keras package\n",
    "\n",
    "* The example notebook was run in Google COLAB without any package installation. I advise you to use Google COLAB with a GPU instance for the last task.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Where not asked otherwise, use the default settings for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You may try running the models using more CPU cores to speed the training (sklearn supports for most of the models with a parameter, usually n_jobs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Load the CIFAR 10 dataset from the `tf.keras.datasets` API and train a `LogisticRegression` model on the dataset and predict all test outcomes with the `sklearn` API\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create an image grid visualization of randomly selected images (9, 16) with labels.\n",
    "* Preprocess the dataset for `sklearn`, scale the pixels [0-1], and also flatten each example to a vector.\n",
    "* Use the `multi_class='multinomial'` option, describe what it means.\n",
    "* Plot the ROC curves and AUC scores on the same figure for each class.\n",
    "* Calculate the accuracy of the classifier on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelBinarizer` might be useful for you.\n",

    "### 2. Train an `SGDClassifier` regression model on the dataset and predict all the test outcomes with the `sklearn` API. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Select an appropiate loss for this task, explain what this means.\n",
    "* Time is precious, run the classifier paralell on many jobs.\n",
    "* Plot the ROC curves and AUC scores on the same figure for the test set.\n",
    "* Calculate the accuracy of the classifier.\n",
    "* Describe the above model with your own words, how is it different than the logistic regression model?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Train a RandomForest classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "* Plot the ROC curve with AUC scores on the test set.\n",
    "* Calculate accuracy of the classifier on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Train an multi layer perceptron classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "* use the `MLPClassifier` from `sklearn`\n",
    "* Set its parameter to `max_iter = 30` or if you have time, set it for at least `100`. After `30` iterations the model does not converge but gives reasonable predictions (with default parameters).\n",
    "* Plot the ROC curves with AUC scores for the test set.\n",
    "* Calculate the accuracy of the model on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Train a ResNet50 CNN model on the dataset, utilize ImageNet pre-trained weights and fine-tune for at least 3 epochs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* training for 3 epochs should be enough to prove that this model is superior compared to others, train longer to explore the possibilities of the model\n",
